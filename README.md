# A test-driven JS assessment

The original repo (located here https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment) includes a set of tests written using Mocha. 
I have written the code to make the tests pass. 

### Available dependencies

The repo includes jQuery, Backbone, and Underscore. You can use these
libraries when writing your solutions!

This repo uses [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) and
[Chai](http://chaijs.com/) for the tests themselves. It uses the BDD style for authoring tests.
If this doesn't suit you, please fork away, or, better, submit a pull request that lets
this be more flexible than it currently is.
